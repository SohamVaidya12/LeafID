## üöÄ Project Overview  

- **Frontend**: Built with Gradio for an intuitive user interface, enabling users to upload images for classification.  
- **Backend**: Implements OpenCV for image processing, integrates a pre-trained model from Teachable Machine, and supports real-time detection using a webcam feed.  
- **Dataset**: Utilizes a licensed dataset trained on Teachable Machine for Hibiscus and Guava leaf classification.

## üåü Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Seamlessly detects and analyzes leaves using a live webcam feed or uploaded images.  
- **AI-Driven Classification**: Powered by a pre-trained model developed with **Teachable Machine**.  
- **Detailed Reporting**: Automatically generates downloadable PDF reports for each classification.  
- **Optimized Leaf Detection**: Tailored HSV color filtering ensures accurate leaf isolation, even in varying lighting conditions.

## üîç Workflow  

### **1. Data Collection and Model Training**
- Gathered images of Hibiscus and Guava leaves.
- Collected them in the folders and applied augmentation.
- Trained a custom ML model using **Google's Teachable Machine** to classify the two types of leaves.
- Exported the trained model in TensorFlow Lite format (`keras_model.h5`) with labels (`labels.txt`).

### **2. Backend Image Processing**
- Initialized a webcam feed using OpenCV for real-time leaf detection.
- Processed the image frames to isolate leaves based on their green color using HSV color masking.
- Detected the largest contour in the processed mask to identify the leaf region.
- Resized the detected leaf to a standard dimension (300x300 pixels) for model compatibility.

### **3. Classification with Pre-Trained Model**
- Integrated the Teachable Machine model for classification using the `cvzone.ClassificationModule`.
- Used a confidence threshold of 50% to filter predictions.
- Labeled the detected leaf as **Hibiscus leaf** or **Guava leaf** with the confidence percentage.

### **4. User Interaction and Output**
- Provided a **Gradio Interface** for image uploads, classification, and PDF report generation.
- Displayed real-time classification results with bounding boxes and labels using the webcam feed.
- Generated detailed PDF reports summarizing the classification results.

## Backend Overview

The backend of the "LeafID" system utilizes a pretrained machine learning model for real-time classification of leaf types using a webcam. It focuses on identifying **Hibiscus** and **Guava** leaves.

### Key Features:
- **Leaf Detection**: Uses OpenCV to capture and process the webcam feed.
- **Contour Detection**: Isolates the largest contour, assumed to be the leaf.
- **Pretrained Model**: Trained with **Teachable Machine** for Hibiscus and Guava leaf classification.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Displays the classified leaf type with a confidence score.

### Process:
1. Capture the webcam feed.
2. Process and isolate the leaf using color filtering and contour detection.
3. Classify the leaf using the pretrained model.
4. Display the classification result on the video feed.

### Libraries and Tools Used:
- **OpenCV** for image processing.
- **cvzone** for model classification.
- **Teachable Machine** for the custom model.
