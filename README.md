# LeafID: ML-Based Leaf Identification System

**LeafID** is a machine learning-based system designed for the identification and classification of plant leaves, specifically Hibiscus and Guava leaves. The project combines image processing techniques and a deep learning model to provide accurate leaf type predictions, confidence scores, and detailed descriptions.

## Features

- **Leaf Detection and Classification**: Utilizes HSV color space for leaf isolation and a pre-trained deep learning model for classification.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides a confidence percentage for each classification result.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Automatically generates a detailed report including the leaf type, confidence score, and a description of the classification.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly Gradio-based interface for easy uploading, classification, and report download.
